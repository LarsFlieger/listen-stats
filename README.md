This directory contains a fully client‑side implementation of the
Spotify History Analyzer. The application is delivered as a static
website – simply open `index.html` in your browser and use the
interface to upload your Spotify `Streaming_History_Audio_*.json`
files. All analysis runs locally in your browser; no information
leaves your machine.
