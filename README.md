This directory contains a fully client‑side implementation of the
Spotify History Analyzer.  The application is delivered as a static
website – simply open `index.html` in your browser and use the
interface to upload your Spotify `Streaming_History_Audio_*.json`
files.  All analysis runs locally in your browser; no information
leaves your machine.

*Note: the landing page has been updated to ListenStats and includes
an overview of features, pricing information, a tutorial and a
contribution link.*
